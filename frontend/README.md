## Component

* Component는 확장자를 f7.html 을 사용합니다 ( 웹팩 설정에서 partial 파일은 따로 framework7-component 로더를 사용을 합니다.)
* `src/components/...`  Path에 `*.f7.html` 파일들을 모아둡니다.
* `src/js/components.j` 에서  `Framework7.registerComponent` 을 통해  register 합니다.

```javascript
// src/js/components.js 
import Framework7 from "framework7/framework7.esm.bundle.js";
import CategoriesGrid from "../components/_categories_grid.f7.js";

Framework7.registerComponent("categories-grid", CategoriesGrid);
```

```html
<!-- ~~.f7.html -->
<categories-grid></categories-grid>
```

## WebPack

There is a webpack bundler setup. It compiles and bundles all "front-end" resources. You should work only with files located in `/src` folder. Webpack config located in `build/webpack.config.js`.

Webpack has specific way of handling static assets (CSS files, images, audios). You can learn more about correct way of doing things on [official webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/).

## PWA

This is a PWA. Don't forget to check what is inside of your `service-worker.js`. It is also recommended that you disable service worker (or enable "Update on reload") in browser dev tools during development.
## Capacitor

This project created uses Capacitor. Check out [official Capacitor documentation](https://capacitorjs.com) for more examples and usage examples.



## Assets

Assets (icons, splash screens) source images located in `assets-src` folder. To generate your own icons and splash screen images, you will need to replace all assets in this directory with your own images (pay attention to image size and format), and run the following command in the project directory:

```
framework7 assets
```

Or launch UI where you will be able to change icons and splash screens:

```
framework7 assets --ui
```

## Capacitor Assets

Capacitor assets are located in `resources` folder which is intended to be used with `cordova-res` tool. To generate  mobile apps assets run in terminal:
```
npx cordova-res
```

Check out [official cordova-res documentation](https://github.com/ionic-team/cordova-res) for more usage examples.
